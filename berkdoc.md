BerkDoc is an AI-powered knowledge management platform designed to help teams organize, explore, and understand large collections of text-based documents.

Instead of static folders, BerkDoc uses language models to infer semantic relationships between documents, enabling flexible, multi-dimensional views of the same information. Documents can live in multiple contexts at once—across projects, topics, or workflows—without duplication.

Core Concepts
	•	Semantic Organization: Documents are automatically connected based on meaning, not just location.
	•	Infinite Canvas UI: Knowledge can be explored spatially (similar to tools like Figma or Miro), not just as lists.
	•	Live Folders: Collections that auto-update as documents are added or their meaning changes.
	•	Multi-Context Documents: A single document can appear in multiple folders or hierarchies simultaneously.
